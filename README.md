First Project - based on creating a small game


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Based on Adventure Time with Finn & Jake


Technologies:
-------------

* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT

Methodology:
-----------

Used trello to keep a map of what I wanted to do, but mainly stuck to using notes taken and bullet points kept in note pad.

As we had 4 days I set one day to get the idea, two days for working on logic (hardest part) and workings of the game and then one day for styling and one day to to do final tidy up and iron out bugs and solve bonus things I wanted in the game.

In order to get the game up and running, i created psuedo code as to what I wnated the game to do.

This consisted of:

 - What theme game I wanted to go for based on my likes
 - What would it look like on screen
 - How does the game function
 - How does one win?
 - How does one lose?
 - What should the parts of the code look like that 	have to build the logic

My code break down began on working out how to make the keys correspond to my presses and make the images on the screen disappear as the user input key strokes.

Around this I then added further game logic such as, penalties for incorrect strokes. An added bonus i got working to make the game harder was points deduction for every second that passes.

There is also styling applied once the game reaches a certain level, so the pictures of finn & jake change depending on if you have made jake happy or not.

DOM manipulation was very useful for amending things on the fly quickly to see what was the desired effect to change elements on page & console log for whether logic I was building was firing.

Unsolved Problems
-----------------

Managed to tackle some frustrating problems which I could not solve at the begining of this project such as:

- Prevent user input when game has ended
- Added user bonus of making timer deduct score each second
- CSS wise could not figure how to resize all my divs when screen is reduced, which was frustrating
- Sound on chrome browser proved problematic but managed to get working at the end
- Could have found a much simpler countdown timer
- Would like to refactor my code next time (oop)
